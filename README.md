## Introduction
In systems biology, it is very important to formalize the model for biological phenomenon and analyze based on this model basically constructed by ordinary differential equation (ODE). The model is normally described by Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and there are several software tools to create the model easily. Regarding the analysis, this is mainly considered as simulation, steady state analysis, and parameter estimation. Using method of simulation, we get the realization of each species in model by the minute. This result enables us to understand the dynamical variation of species in model. Steady state analysis can give us the final expression in time enough passed. This approach is effective to estimate whether each species is worked in considered condition. The parameter estimation focuses on the identification of unknown parameters in model considering the expression value obtained by experiment. These methodologies are mathematically formalized and the library to analyze, COPASI for instance, already exists. However, establishing the environment of analysis is difficult for biologists. Therefore, this is one of the obstacle to analyze ODE model easily.
